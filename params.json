The tool crawls a site to find all of the documents then analyses each document with a number of validation tools.\r\n\r\nVersion 4.0.1 contains the following updates and additions\r\n - Add open data checking tool (open_data_check.pl and desktop shortcut)  to check open dataset files (dictionary, data, resources).\r\n - Do case insensitive checks on titles to find matching HTML and PDF versions of a document.\r\n - Allow for binary data in CSV files (e.g. new-line in the cell content).\r\n - Report Interoperability failure for web feeds that do not parse properly - SWI_B.\r\n - Check for table headers that reference undefined headers or headers outside the current table - WCAG_2.0-H43.\r\n - Check for all language markers to determine if a page is archived or not (handles the case where wrong language message is used).\r\n - Encode text that is written to results tabs, this eliminates garbled French characters.\r\n - Report unknown mime-type documents as non-HTML primary format.\r\n - Accept enter key in URL list tab to move to the next input line.\r\n - Check for very long (> 500 characters) title and heading text - WCAG_2.0-H42, WCAG_2.0-H25\r\n - Don't report zoom failure for fix size fonts as current browsers can handle this - WCAG_2.0-G142\r\n - Decode HTML entities before checking the length of titles and headings to eliminate the length of the HTML code from the actual text length.\r\n\r\n\r\nReminder: The WPSS Tool DOES NOT validate HTML5 markup.\r\n\r\n# WPSS_Tool Installer\r\n\r\nThe tool installer, WPSS_Tool.exe, does NOT include the required Perl or Python installers (as was the case for previous releases).
